c This is a small example graph in the DIMACS format.
c Lines starting with "c" are comments and can be ignored
c by the solver.
c A line starting with "p edge" is used to declare the number
c of vertices and edges.
c Lines starting with "e" give the edges of the graph.
c The following graph has 5 vertices (1,2,3,4,5) and 7
c edges (1-2, 1-4, 2-4, 2-5, 3-4, 3-5, 4-5).
p edge 5 7
